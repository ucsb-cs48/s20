# Details

## Retro

Reminder that during a retro, you should *gather input from everyone* before starting to discuss.

It is an "anti-pattern" to just jump into discussion before gathering input.   
* Staff, please intervene if you hear that happening!

Darby/Larsen's five stages of a successful retro:
* Open the Retro
  - check in, e.g. rose/thorn, personal weather report
* Gather input: * (1) before discussion (2) in writing (3) in silence (4) from everyone*
* Generate Insights: * each person reads their input, discussion leader facilitates grouping/categorizing *
  - also a good time to review info from last retro; what was the experiment, how did it turn out?
* Decide What To do: *come up with action plan.*
* Close The Retro
  - appreciations
  
Bookkeeping (note: these items affect your team's grade and your individual grade):

* `team/LEADERSHIP.md` should list who is leading 05/26 third retro
* `team/RETROS.md` should have a section for the final retro with same items as for other retros
* everyone should fill out post-retro survey
  
## Sprint Planning

Update `team/LEADERSHIP.md` with:
* Who did demo last Thursday 
* Who
