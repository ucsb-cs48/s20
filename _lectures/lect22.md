# MAKE GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME TOGETHER

Real world teams have 40 hours a week during which they can meet/work.

You all have 200 minutes each week.  That's all.  3â…“ hours.  91% less time.

It's great to see: 
* folks sharing their screen, discussing things energetically.
* folks demoing features to one another
* folks reviewing PRs

It is concerning to see:
* No one sharing their screen
* No one talking

Some things to keep in mind if you find you are at a loss:
* If you need to work in pairs/trios, we have extra break out rooms we can put you in.
* It you have PRs that haven't been code reviewed, consider reviewing them as a team
  - review the code
  - review the features (i.e. run the code on QA)
