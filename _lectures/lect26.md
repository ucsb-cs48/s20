* [lab10]({{page.lab10}}): Final project report

* In your meeting today, go over this and assign team members to do part 1, part 2, and part 3.
* Note that for part 3, *each team member* should initially write their own section.    
  - Suggestion: each team member should initially create a draft of their part in `part3_Alice.md`, `part3_Bob.md`, `part3_Carol.md`, `part3_Danny.md`
  - Then: the person writing the overall report can copy/paste those separate files into the unified file, and delete the 
    separate drafts.
* Today: Review the `/graphs/contributors` report for your project repo.
