# Announcements

## Final Presentations

* Reminder that the final exam slot is for course presentations
* All members of the team should be present for the final presentation (as in live online in Zoom)
  - All members *may* be in the final presentation video, but that's not a requirement
  - But all members should be online available to answer questions about the product.

## Final Course Grades

* 50% all the lab / homework grades (including lab10 participation).
* 50% your final project (which is a combination of lab10 content, and the four other criteria listed in the lecture notes for [lect26]({{page.lect26}}).

To clarify: lab10 counts twice:
* Once towards the lab / homework component: here we are just looking to be sure that you 
  completed the work as requested (it's more of a "participation grade").
* Once towards the overall project grade.  Here, we are looking at the content as part of a holistic review of the
  entire project quality.

Here's how I arrived at the 50/50 split.  I started with the breakdown used in W20, when there was 
also an exam: 

| Item | % |
|-|-|
| Hwks, In Class Assignments 	| 15% |
| Project Grade (labs) 	| 30% |
| Exam  |	20% |
| Project Grade (final product) 	| 35% |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}

Moving the final exam grade into the final project grade would give a 45% / 55% split; from there, I've simplified to 50/50.  I've combined the homeworks and labs into one category for simplicity.
