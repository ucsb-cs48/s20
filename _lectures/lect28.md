## ESCI Reminder (Course Evaluations)

You are likely getting many reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs).  I would like to also remind you to please take a moment to enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important.

See reminders from Tuesday's lecture about:
* the importance of comments
* keeping praise and criticism focused on your learning, rather than enjoyment or personality
* being aware of implicit bias

# One lesson learned:

* `git bisect` is cool

# Note for lab10: Add some notes on testing in Part 2

I encourage you to add a section in part 2, your programmers guide, that *describes your testing approach*.

What I mean is, to add a few sentences or bullet points that describe:
* What parts of your code have unit testing
* What parts of your code have cypress testing 
  - Or for Spring Boot: Integration or Selenium testing
 
This doesn't have to be super long or detailed; just a high level description. 
* Some teams have more test coverage, and some have less
* Doing nothing beyond lab07 doesn't count *against* you, but
* If you did *more* than the minimum required for lab07, we want to be able to give you credit for it.

# Time to work with your teams

* Final scheduled standup
* Do you need another before final presentation?
  - If so, now is the best time to work out the schedule
* Decide:
  - what *isn't* getting done
  - of what *is* still left to be done, what is *really* necessary?
* Determine:
  - Most crucial tech blockers
