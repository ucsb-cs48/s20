## ESCI Reminder (Course Evaluations)

You are likely getting many reminders from the automated system about course evaluations (ESCIs).  I would like to also remind you to please take a moment to enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important.

Response rate as of 1:48pm 06/04/2020:

|Lecture Time|Course ID |	Enrollment Count	|Surveys Completed	|Percent Completed|
|-|-|-|-|-|
| TR 3:30pm | CMPSC 48 0200	| 44	| 25 |	56.82% |
| TR 5pm  | CMPSC 48 0100	| 37	| 12	| 35.14% |

See reminders from Tuesday's lecture about:
* the importance of comments
* keeping praise and criticism focused on your learning, rather than enjoyment or personality
* being aware of implicit bias

# One lesson learned:

* `git bisect` is cool

# Note for lab10: Add some notes on testing in Part 2

I encourage you to add a section in part 2, your programmers guide, that *describes your testing approach*.

What I mean is, to add a few sentences or bullet points that describe:
* What parts of your code have unit testing
* What parts of your code have cypress testing 
  - Or for Spring Boot: Integration or Selenium testing
 
This doesn't have to be super long or detailed; just a high level description. 
* Some teams have more test coverage, and some have less
* Doing nothing beyond lab07 doesn't count *against* you, but
* If you did *more* than the minimum required for lab07, we want to be able to give you credit for it.

# Time to work with your teams

* Final scheduled standup
* Do you need another before final presentation?
  - If so, now is the best time to work out the schedule
* Decide:
  - what *isn't* getting done
  - of what *is* still left to be done, what is *really* necessary?
* Determine:
  - Most crucial tech blockers

# Final Thoughts


I have been **really pleased** with what I've been seeing when I stop in your groups.

Here's the course description for CS48, turned into a bullet list:

> Team-based project development. Topics include 
>
> * software engineering and professional development practices, 
> * interface design, 
> * advanced library support
> * techniques for team-oriented design and development
> * testing and test-driven development
> * software reliability and robustness. 
>
> Students present and demonstrate final projects.

Note that "web development" isn't on the list; we learned some of that, but that was a *means to an end*.

Where I see some real mastery is:
* **professional development practices**
* **team oriented design and development**

I pop in on breakout rooms and I hear you talking about different feature branches and pull requests, QA and production, front-end and back-end, issues, acceptance criteria and your kanban board. 

I no longer hear "student teams".   What I hear is the sounds of software industry professionals at work.

I'm really proud of what we've accomplished this quarter.  I hope you are too.
