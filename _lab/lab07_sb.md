This lab is an alternative for Spring Boot to [lab07](https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/s20/lab/lab07/).

To earn the points for this lab, the project should have:
* at least one example of a plain old JUnit test for some plain old Java code
* at least one example of either an integration test, or an end-to-end (Selenium) test for a product feature.

This article has a good introduction to end-to-end testing for Spring Boot Projects:
