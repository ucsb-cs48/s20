This lab is an alternative for Spring Boot to [lab07](https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/s20/lab/lab07/).

To earn the points for this lab, the project should have:
* at least one example of a plain old JUnit test for some plain old Java code
* at least one example of either an integration test, or an end-to-end (Selenium) test for a product feature.

This article has a good introduction to end-to-end testing for Spring Boot Projects:
* <https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/topics/testing_end_to_end/>

Please be in close contact with your mentor, and if needed, your TA and instructor; since only one team is completing this version of the lab, we are relying on frequent contact between the team and the course staff rather than detailed instrutions.
Seek clarification on what you don't understand, and guidance on how to proceed.
